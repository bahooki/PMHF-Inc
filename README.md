Performing Asset analysis using free sources of online data
===========================================================

Current Version: v0.1

A project to leverage yahoofinancials api to identify entry and exit points for put and call contracts using candlestick pattern analysis
https://github.com/JECSand/yahoofinancials


Overview
========

Pooling capital from multiple investors, we want to produce a higher return than a given comparison [insert comparison] using home built financial analysis models.  
Through our own fundamentals based research we will identify target sectors and companies that we will feed into the module methods to programatically analyze trend data to determine short term trading opportunities. Using options contracts we will leverage our pooled capital. 

Defining exit points will be important to limit losses quickly. 
Positions will be short term in nature, typically no more than 60-90 days.  

Importantly we will ensue that we are not overly concentrated using correlation coefficients/covariance methods. 

Distributions will be paid out monthly to investors based on the sum total of all closed contracts within that monthly window.
